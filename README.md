# Web Development Project 2 - *SWE Flashcards üòé*

## Submitted by: **Truc Duong**

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Inspiration 
In this project, I will be creating a web app for learning some fundamental concepts in the SWE industry.
User will be able to use the study cards in a randomized order.

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## üéØ Goals
By the end of this assignment I will be able to
- [x] Create a new component
- [x] Share a small piece of data from one component to the next
- [x] Utilize `useState()` to create state variables to help control component behavior
- [x] use the `onClick()` event to call a method
- [x] create multiple `div` sections to keep track of different chunks of information
- [x] use those `div` sections as the basis for CSS styling

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The title of the card set and some information about it, such as a short description and the total number of cards are displayed**
- [x] **A single card at a time is displayed, only showing one of the components of the information pair**
- [x] **A list of card pairs is created**
- [x] **Clicking on the card shows the corresponding component of the information pair**
- [x] **Clicking the next button displays a random new card**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Cards contains images in addition to or in place of text
- [ ] Cards have different visual styles such as color based on their category
  - [ ] *visual style implemented*

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

## Notes

- At first, I didn't know where to start, but then I tried sketching out the components and went from there.
- The card flipping CSS animation is kinda cool tbh.

## üß† Brainstorming:
- To control the front and back of a flashcard:
  - Create a state variable to keep track of whether the card is flipped to the front or not.
  - Use [inline conditional rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html#inline-if-else-with-conditional-operator) to show either the question or answer on the card based on the state variable
- To make flashcards have cool animations for flipping to the front and back: [resource](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp)
